## <a name="vacation">Vacation</a>
For legal reasons, the official vacation is listed as 4 weeks a year. That restriction is really only there for legal protection. We believe everyone is a responsible adult and understands what is reasonable. If you can't then you shouldn't be here ;).  We don't have set holidays off. Everyone has different beliefs, different interests, so it is really up to you to decide when you want to be off.

Given we are working on clients with deadlines, we just ask to give proper notice when you are going to be out. If you are in the middle of a project and everyone is depending on you, it probably isn't a good idea to disappear for a week on short notice. Again, this should be obvious and isn't asking much. There is a lot of flexibility, we just ask you to handle it responsibly.

Holidays that most of the office are generally out (but aren't required) are:

* Christmas
* Thanksgiving
* Good Friday
* July 4th
* Memorial day
* Labor day


## <a name="hours">Hours</a>
We use [LetsFreckle](http://dreamsocket.letsfreckle.com) for all recording all hours. You must be granted an account to access it. In addition, each project has access restrictions. Please ask if you need access granted to the system or a project. 

Make sure to log time against the correct client/project. If you are unsure, ask. 

When logging hours always use the built in Timer to stop and start your time. On the website, this can be found in the left hand nav. If you are on a Mac, we encourage you to [download it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freckle/id879917538?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) from the Mac App Store.

Always use the timer and accurately record your time. We work on time and materials with most of our projects. If you are recording hours while you aren't working that will add up over time. Say you recorded an extra 30 minutes a day, that is 2.5 hours a week or 10 hours a month. We don't want to overbill our clients. Ethics and honesty are at the core of what we do, so please make sure to accurately reflect that in what you record. There aren't internal incentives or penalizations based on how much you charge, but rather on whether you get your work done.  


## <a name="sourcecontrol">Source control</a>
At Dreamsocket we use both Github and Bitbucket for source control. All our repositories are currently Git based. We use Github for projects for all our public repos and where we need to grant access to a large number of people on a project. We use Bitbucket for the majority of our repos where we have a lot more projects, but fewer people working on them.

If you are a Dreamsocket employee, you will be granted team access to all repos on both systems. If you are a contractor, you will be added to a team that relates to the work you are doing and granted specific access to repos for that team.

When doing check ins, we have a very simple tagging system for all change notes.

Use the following tags:

* [ADMIN] - when initially adding a repo
* [NEW] - adding a new feature, file, etc
* [FIX] - corrected something that was broken
* [CHG] - a change to an existing item has been made
* [DEL] - when removing an item, file, etc

Although you can see files changed by just looking at the change log, that is only a file based record. It requires a lot inference to figure out things that were changed, removed, added, etc. By using these simple tags, the change notes provides a very quick snapshot of what was modified for that commit.
